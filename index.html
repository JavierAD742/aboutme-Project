        <p>I currently live in Brooklyn, NY before I moved to Brooklyn I was living in Queens, NY. As a kid, I didn't grow up aspiring to be a developer as far as I can remember I wanted to be a rapper in junior high school but that wasn't an option anymore for me. When I was in high school I aspired to be an electrician but soon after I took scriptED classes in 11th grade which introduced me to coding and I got hooked. It took many years for me to look for boot camps I just thought that the only way to become a developer was by going through college but I learned otherwise in 2022. I found out about the Knowledge House and it is safe to say that I am now putting all the work into becoming a Fullstack developer, I am currently attending that Software Engineering boot camp which I will be attending from Sept 2023 to Sept 2024 Thanks for hearing my story on how I learned and now pursuing a career in this field.</p>
